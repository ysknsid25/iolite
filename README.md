# iolite

Value Objects for Kotlin. Inspired by [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod). **We never use 3rd party libraries**.

## Origin of project name

- Inspired by Zod. Zod's icon is a blue gem, so I thought I'd use the gem's name.
- I thought of jewels with similar colors to Kotlin's brand color.
- Because [my favorite artist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPLPI-cs7xg) has a song with the same name.
